								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>
									Sanitizor is an Android-based mobile game app that was created to bring some joy and light during the time of the pandemic.
									Themed after the classic arcade-style games of Galaga and Space Invaders, the player controls a bottl of hand sanitizer that is fighting off the evil COVID particles.
									Each wave brings in more COVID particles that have different attack and movement styles (as shown by their color). 
									Defeat enemies to gain power-ups, earn points, and clear levels and fight to become the best Sanitizor on the leaderboard. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Players can log in using their Google play account to be able to get their score on the leaderboard and compete to be the top.
									Throughout the game you can shoot drops of sanitizer to fight the COVID particles. Whenever a particle dies, it has a chance to drop a powerup, which the user can pickup and gain bonuses.
									Powerups include a face-mask which gives an extra life, or upgraded sanitizer bottle which allows the player to shoot rapid-fire for a short time.

								<h4>The Team</h4>

									This project was developed as part of a team. The team consisted of Jesse Breslin, Chase Crossley, and myself (pictured below from left to right).

								<h4>My Portion of the Project</h4>
								<p>
									I worked on a few different areas of the game. The first was I created the player movement systems (joystick screen control and gyroscope-based tilt controls). 
									I created the Google sign-in feature as well as the score and leaderboard systems. 
									I also created the player projectile system, the music, sound effects, and the graphics.
								</p>

								<h4>Technical Details</h4>
								<p>
									The project was created using Android Studio with Java. We used a Canvas-based screen to draw the player and the enemies.
									We used frame-based animation that changed the sprite of the object in order to show animations. We used math with Rect bounds in order to perform collision detection.
									We used a Firestore Database for the leaderboard which uses a Google sign-in to relate the scores to the user.
